<h3 id="the-before">The “Before”</h3>

<p>This site was originally stood up November 2020 as just a HTML/CSS template on
a tiny VPS. It took the better part of a weekend to get the domain, nginx, and
LetsEncrypt configuration all set up (mostly because I had no idea what I was
doing), and aside from the occassional updates and reboots, the site remained
largely unchanged for the duration of its tenure.</p>

<p>I was pretty proud of it, sure, but as time went on, a few things started to
bother me. My lack of familiarity with HTML/CSS meant there was no good avenue
for me to write (which I wanted to do) without first learning some front-end,
and the manual configuration meant that if, for whatever reason, my site were
to break, it could/would require quite a bit of time and effort to set up
<em>all over again</em>.</p>

<p>I needed something better.</p>

<h3 id="the-fix">The “Fix”</h3>

<p>Automate everything.</p>

<p>Some software I chose and why:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home">Jekyll</a>: I wanted a site that was dead simple to edit, so a
static-site generator was a natural choice. I also like Markdown and LaTeX.</li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.docker.com/">Docker</a>/<a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">Compose</a>: I wanted something that was easy to
deploy, and was relatively portable.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.jenkins.io/doc/">Jenkins</a>: I want something that I can <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit</code>, and everything
else is done automatically. Also I want my own CI server.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s getting close to midnight and I don’t feel like writing up <em>every</em> single
step I took, so I’ll just summarize the workflow, and document some of the more
troublesome steps in case I ever have to do it again. Skip to the end for that.</p>

<p>All goes well, I should never have to start <em>completely</em> from scratch ever
again.</p>

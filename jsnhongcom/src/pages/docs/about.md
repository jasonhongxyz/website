Welcome to my corner of the Internet! 

I write about technology, literature, and anything else I find interesting. My
hope is anyone exploring my site to walk away having seen or learned something
cool. :)

I received a BA in Computer Science from Boston University, with a minor in
English. In my free time, I click heads on [Twitch][twitch] and [read][readings].
